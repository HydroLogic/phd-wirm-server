      <h1>Getting Started</h1>
      <p>Welcome to the Web-based Interactive River Model (WIRM), a web application created to demonstrate the use of modern web technologies for web-based simulation of environmental systems. The application was designed to provide a highly interactive simulation interface using only standard web technologies eliminating the need for third-party browser plug-ins (e.g. Java applets, Flash). Read more about the architecture of the website on the <a href="/about/">About</a> page.</p>
      <p>This page describes what simulation models are and why they are used, as well as the scientific background on the specific model utilized on this site.</p>

      <h2>The Modelling Process</h2>
      <h3>What are simulation models?</h3>
      <p>Simulation models are commonly used by scientists and engineers to study environmental systems such as lakes, rivers, forests, grasslands, etc. Some people might think of models as miniature versions of real systems (think model airplanes or model trains), and indeed, some researchers do create so-called physical models that are small-scale replicas of environmental systems. But environmental systems are incredibly complex, involving dynamic interactions between many physical, chemical, biological and even socioeconomic processes. Representing all of these complex processes in a physical model is virtually impossible, and so scientists and engineers use mathematical equations to represent these systems and processes.</p>
      
      <h3>Why use Simulation Models?</h3>
      While traditional scientific experiments are sometimes used to study environmental systems, oftentimes it is not feasible to perform experiments on real systems, especially large systems like entire watersheds or oceans. By using simulation models, scientists and engineers can study the behavior of environmental systems using so-called "numerical experiments." Once a model is created and tested, it can be used to study what happens when parts of the system are changed. For example, a model of a watershed can be used to predict what will happen to the amount of streamflow when rainfall patterns change due to climate change, and what might those changes do to the native fish populations.</p>
      
      <h3>How are simulation models used to make decisions?</h3>
      <p>Simulation models allow scientists and engineers to investigate "what if" scenarios, helping us better understand what effects humans are having on environmental systems and what management actions or policies would be most effective in reducing our impacts and protecting these important ecosystems.</p>
      
      <p>Management decisions for water quality problems are primarily based on the question: how much of a given pollutant can be discharged to a waterbody without having unacceptable negative impacts? This question is often answered by using a simulation model that let's the user lower the amount of pollution until it has a minimal (or acceptable) impact.</p>

      <h2>Scientific Background of WIRM</h2>
      <p>The WIRM application simulates the effect of wastewater discharge (or similar types of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_source_pollution">point source pollution</a>) on dissolved oxygen levels in rivers and streams. The underlying mathematical model is derived from one of the first water quality models known as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streeter-Phelps_equation">Streeter-Phelps model</a> dating back to a study on the Ohio River in the 1925. This model was instrumental in understanding the effect of wastewater discharge on dissolved oxygen concentrations in rivers.</p>
      <h4>Dissolved Oxygen</h4>
      <p>Although you may often think of it as a gas in the air, oxygen dissolves in water to become dissolved oxygen (DO), which is needed for the survival of fish and other aquatic oranisms. The minimum DO concentration varies by species and organism, but is typically between 4 and 6 mg/L. A number of physical, chemical and biological processes affect the concentration of DO in rivers and lakes. DO is consumed by many biological decomposition, but also produced by photosynthesis. Gas exchange between the water and the atmosphere also changes the concentration of DO, driving it towards a state of equilibrium. Chemical processes such as oxidation can also affect DO levels. In reality, there are countless processes that affect DO, but by focusing on the most important ones we can still gain a clear picture of the system dynamics controlling the levels of DO in a given river.</p>
      <h4>Biochemical Oxygen Deman</h4>
      <p>Before the invention of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewage_treatment#Secondary_treatment">modern treatment technologies</a>, wastewater discharge contained high concentrations of organic compounds. When these organic compounds are released in the environment, they are decomposed by microbial organisms through a process called respiration, a process that requires the consumption of oxygen (similar to human respiration). The total amount of oxygen that is consumed by the process is referred to as the Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD). For example, if 8 mg/L of DO is required to consume all the organic compounds in a sample of water, then the concentration of BOD is 8 mg/L. Therefore, high concentrations of BOD result in the consumption of large amounts of oxygen due to microbial respiration. Futhermore, if the BOD concentration is greater than the DO concentration, then microbial respiration may consume all the available dissolved oxygen leaving fish and other organisms unable to survive.</p>

      <h2>Summary</h2>
      Management of environmental systems often require the use of simulation models to gain a better understanding of these complex systems. One such management quesiton is what is the concentration of BOD The decomposition of organic compounds (BOD) results in the consumption of dissolved oxygen by microbial respiration, which can have a harmful effect on fish and other animals that live in the ecosystem.</p>
