    <p>Before using WIRM, this tutorial will walk you through the steps for properly using the model to better understand how best to use it.</p>

    <h3>Model Interpretation</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="span9">
    <p>Before discussing the user interface, it is useful to understand how to interpret the model output generated by the simulation. Here is an example using the default parameter values:</p>
    <img src="{% static "img/tutorial/annotated_output.png" %}" alt="Annotated Output" width="530" height="412">
    <p>The blue and orange lines represent the simulated concentrations of BOD and DO along a stretch of river. The chart also shows the DO saturation concentration as the dotted black line for reference.</p>
    <p>The left side of the chart (x=0) represents the upstream end of the reach where BOD is being discharged into the river from a point source such as a wastewater treatment plant. Initially, the concentrations of BOD and DO decrease just downstream of the discharge as BOD undergoes microbial decomposition and chemical oxidation, which are processes that consume DO.</p>
    <p>At some point downstream of the discharge, the DO concentration reaches a minimum value, often called the <strong>critical point</strong>. At this point, the rates of BOD decay and DO reaeration are balanced because the oxygen lost by BOD decomposition is being replenished by an equivalent amount of oxygen dissolving into the water from the air. Past the critical point, DO increases as the rate of reaeration exceeds the rate of BOD decay and more oxygen is dissolving into the water than is being consumed. Eventually, the BOD has been completely decomposed and its concentration approaches zero. Without any BOD decomposition, the DO level approaches the saturation concentration where it is in equilibrium with the air. The dip in the DO concentration is known as the <strong>DO sag</strong>, which is a characteristic curve often observed downstream of BOD discharges.</p>

    <h3>Open Application</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="span9">
    <p>To open the model application, either</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Visit the URL: <a href="http://wirm.walkerjeff.com/client/">http://wirm.walkerjeff.com/client/</a></li>
      <li>
        <p>Navigate to the <code>Model</code> &gt; <code>New Project</code> on the navigation bar</p>

    <h3>New Project</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="span9">
    <p>Once the application is loaded, you can begin a new project. A <strong>Project</strong> is an application of the model to a specific river under specific conditions. For example, one project may represent the Mississippi River under low flow conditions when a wastewater treatment plant is discharging a typical load. Another project could represent the same river under different conditions such as high flow and reduced wastewater discharge.</p>
