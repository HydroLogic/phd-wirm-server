    <h3>Introduction</h3>

    <p>Before using WIRM, this tutorial will walk you through the steps for properly using the model to better understand how best to use it.</p>

    <h3>Model Interpretation</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="span9">
    <p>Before discussing the user interface, it is useful to understand how to interpret the model output generated by the simulation. Here is an example using the default parameter values:</p>
    <img src="{% static "img/tutorial/annotated_output.png" %}" alt="Annotated Output" width="530" height="412">
    <p>The blue and orange lines represent the simulated concentrations of BOD and DO along a stretch of river. The chart also shows the DO saturation concentration as the dotted black line for reference.</p>
    <p>The left side of the chart (x=0) represents the upstream end of the reach where BOD is being discharged into the river from a point source such as a wastewater treatment plant. Initially, the concentrations of BOD and DO decrease just downstream of the discharge as BOD undergoes microbial decomposition and chemical oxidation, which are processes that consume DO.</p>
    <p>At some point downstream of the discharge, the DO concentration reaches a minimum value, often called the <strong>critical point</strong>. At this point, the rates of BOD decay and DO reaeration are balanced because the oxygen lost by BOD decomposition is being replenished by an equivalent amount of oxygen dissolving into the water from the air. Past the critical point, DO increases as the rate of reaeration exceeds the rate of BOD decay and more oxygen is dissolving into the water than is being consumed. Eventually, the BOD has been completely decomposed and its concentration approaches zero. Without any BOD decomposition, the DO level approaches the saturation concentration where it is in equilibrium with the air. The dip in the DO concentration is known as the <strong>DO sag</strong>, which is a characteristic curve often observed downstream of BOD discharges.</p>

    <h3>Open Application</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="span9">
    <p>To open the model application, either</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Visit the URL: <a href="http://wirm.walkerjeff.com/client/">http://wirm.walkerjeff.com/client/</a></li>
      <li>
        <p>Click <code>Model</code> &gt; <code>New Project</code> on the navigation bar</p>
        <img src="{% static "img/tutorial/new_project.png" %}" alt="New Project" width="539" height="126">

<div class="row row-doc">
  <div class="span3">
    <h3>New Project</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="span9">
    <p>Once the application is loaded, the user is presented with the <strong>New Project</strong> interface. A <strong>Project</strong> is an application of the model for a specific river and under specific conditions. Each New Project is based on the default parameter values. The user needs to adjust each of these parameters based on the characteristics of the river of interest.</p>
    <p>The model parameters are grouped into two tabs:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Basic</strong>: the basic parameters must all be defined by the user. These parameters are the minimum amount of information necessary to represent a unique river.</li>
      <li><strong>Advanced</strong>: the advanced parameters should also be reviewed, but are more difficult to assign. For example, the BOD decay rate at 20C typically requires laboratory experiments of water samples to estimate.</li>
    </ul>
    <img src="{% static "img/tutorial/set_parameters.png" %}" alt="Set Parameters" width="594" height="483">
    <p>Changes to the parameters values can be undone by clicking the <code>Reset</code> button, which resets the parameters to the default values.</p>

    <h3>Saving a Project</h3>  
  </div>
  <div class="span9">
    <p>Once the parameter values have been adjusted to match a specific river, the user can save the project to the server by clicking the <code>Save</code> button.</p>
    <img src="{% static "img/tutorial/save_button.png" %}" alt="Save Project" width="278" height="114">
    <hr>
    <p>The user must then fill out the new project form by setting the <code>Title</code>, <code>Location</code> and <code>Description</code> of the project, and clicking the <code>Save</code> button.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Title</strong>: short description used to identify the project such as the name of the river</li>
      <li><strong>Location</strong>: the geographic location such as the state or country where the river is located</li>
      <li><strong>Description</strong>: additional information about the project such as the name of the BOD discharge source, location of the simulated reach, or flow conditions used to define the model.</li>
    </ul>
    <img src="{% static "img/tutorial/project_modal.png" %}" alt="New Project Form" width="565" height="450">
    <p>After the project is saved to the server, the browser will automatically be redirected to the URL assigned to the new project.</p>

    <h3>Loading a Project</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="span9">
    <p>A saved proejct can be loaded by either:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Visiting the unique URL, for example http://wirm.walkerjeff.com/client/#projects/1</li>
      <li>
        <p>Click <code>Model</code> &gt; <code>Saved Projects</code> on the navigation bar</p>
        <img src="{% static "img/tutorial/open_saved_project.png" %}" alt="Open Saved Project" width="527" height="120">
      </li>
    </ul>
    <hr>
    <p>The Saved Projects page will list all existing projects that the user has saved to the server. A project can be loaded by clicking its title, or the <code>Load</code> button. Projects can also be deleted by clicking the <code>Delete</code> button. Note that this list only shows the projects created by the current user, and does not include projects created by other users.</p>

    <h3>Modifying a Saved Project</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="span9">
    <p>Existing project can only be modified by the user who created them (i.e. the "owner"). The owner can edit the project information by clicking the <code>Edit Project Info</code> button, delete the project by clicking the <code>Delete Project</code> button, or save changes to the parameter values by clicking the <code>Save</code> button. Other users may change the parameter values to investigate the parameter sensitivity or effect of changing initial discharge concentration, but they cannot save changes to the server.</p>
    <img src="{% static "img/tutorial/project_info.png" %}" alt="Project Information" width="576" height="170">
    <hr>
    <p>Changes to the parameters values can be undone by clicking the <code>Reset</code> button, which resets the parameter values to the values that were last saved to the server.</p>
    <img src="{% static "img/tutorial/reset_button.png" %}" alt="Reset Parameters" width="290" height="84">

    <h3>Comments</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="span9">
    <p>Comments can be added to any saved project by clicking on the <code>Comments</code> tab. Any registered user can leave comments on any project.</p>

    <h3>Sharing a Project</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="span9">
    <p>Once a project has been saved to the server, it can be easily shared with other users by clicking the <code>Share</code> button.</p>
    <img src="{% static "img/tutorial/share_button.png" %}" alt="Share Button" width="219" height="52">
    <hr>
    <p>The Share Project window provides a unique URL to the current project, which can be copied to the clipboard and pasted into an email or document. Other users can simple paste this URL into their browser and immediately load the saved project. Note that all projects are publically accessible and thus other users do not need to registor or log in to WIRM in order to view exisitng projects.</p>
