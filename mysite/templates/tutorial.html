      <h3>Model Output</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="span9">
      <p>Before discussing the underlying model equations and parameters, its useful to understand the output chart generated by the simulation. Here is an example of the model output:</p>
      <img src="{% static "img/annotation.png" %}" alt="" width="530" height="412">
      <p>The blue and orange lines represent the simulated concentrations of BOD and DO along a stretch of river. The chart also shows the DO saturation concentration as the dotted black line for reference.</p>
      <p>The left side of the chart (x=0) represents the upstream end of the reach where BOD is being discharged into the river from a point source such as a wastewater treatment plant. Initially, the concentrations of BOD and DO decrease just downstream of the discharge as BOD undergoes microbial decomposition, a process that also consumes DO.</p>
      <p>At some point downstream of the discharge, the DO concentration reaches a minimum value, often called the <strong>critical point</strong>. At this point, the rates of BOD decay and DO reaeration are balanced meaning the DO lost by microbial decomposition is being replenished by an equivalent amount of oxygen dissolving into the water from the air. Past the critical point, DO increases as the rate of reaeration exceeds the rate of BOD decay and more oxygen is dissolving into the water than is being consumed by BOD decomposition. Eventually, the BOD has been completely decomposed and its concentration approaches zero. Without any BOD decomposition, the DO level approaches the saturation concentration where it is in equilibrium with the air. The dip in the DO concentration is known as the <strong>DO sag</strong>, which is a characteristic curve often observed downstream of BOD discharges.</p>
      <p>The important question to ask is: <strong>How much BOD can be dischaged without causing the DO sag to fall below some ciritical threshold?</strong></p>

    <h3>Setting Up a New Project</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="span9">
    <p>The first step is to set up a new project. A project is a defined as an application of the model to a specific river or stream under specific conditoins. For example, one project may represent the Mississippi River under low flow conditions when a wastewater treatment plant is discharging a typical load. Another project could represent the same river under different conditions such as high flow and reduced wastewater discharge.</p>
