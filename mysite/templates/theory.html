      <h3>Introduction</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="span9">
      <p>WIRM is a modified version of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streeter-Phelps_equation">Streeter-Phelps equation</a>, which is one of the first water quality models originally developed during a study of the Ohio River in the 1920s (<a href="http://dspace.udel.edu:8080/dspace/bitstream/handle/19716/1590/C%26EE148.pdf?sequence=2">Streeter and Phelps, 1925</a>). The model is used to simulate the effect of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewage_treatment#Secondary_treatment">Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD)</a> point discharge on Dissolved Oxygen (DO) levels of rivers and streams.</p>
      <h5>Dissolved Oxygen</h5>
      <p>Although often thought of as a gas, oxygen readily dissolves into water where it is used by aquatic organisms to survive. The minimum DO concentration varies by species and organism, but is typically between 4 and 6 mg/L. A number of physical, chemical and biological processes affect the concentration of DO in rivers and lakes. DO is consumed by many biological decomposition, but also produced by photosynthesis. Gas exchange between the water and the atmosphere also changes the concentration of DO, driving it towards a state of equilibrium. Chemical processes such as oxidation can also affect DO levels. In reality, there are countless processes that affect DO, but by focusing on the most important ones we can still gain a clear picture of the system dynamics controlling the levels of DO in a given river.</p>
      <h5>Biochemical Oxygen Demand</h5>
      <p>Before the invention of modern treatment technologies, wastewater effluent contained high concentrations of organic compounds. When these organic compounds are released in the environment, they are decomposed by microbial organisms through a process called respiration, a process that requires the consumption of oxygen (similar to human respiration). The total amount of oxygen that is consumed by the process is referred to as the Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD). For example, if 8 mg/L of DO is required to consume all the organic compounds in a sample of water, then the concentration of BOD is 8 mg/L. Therefore, high concentrations of BOD result in the consumption of large amounts of oxygen due to microbial respiration. Futhermore, if the BOD concentration is greater than the DO concentration, then microbial respiration may consume all the available dissolved oxygen leaving fish and other organisms unable to survive.</p>

      <h3>Model Schematic</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="span9">
      <p>This figure shows a schematic diagram of the model, which includes two state variables: the concentrations of BOD, $L$, and DO, $o$. These variables are subject to two processes: 1) BOD decay, which reduces both BOD and DO, and 2) DO reaeration, which is the exchange of oxygen between the water and air that will increase DO if it is below saturation.</p>

      <h3>Equations</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="span9">
      <p>The model schematic shown above is mathematically represented as a system of two ordinary differential equations (ODEs):</p>
      $$\frac{dL}{dt} = -F_{ox}k_dL$$
      $$\frac{do}{dt} = -F_{ox}k_dL+k_a(o_s-o)$$
      <p>where $L$ and $o$ are the concentrations of BOD and DO (mg/L), respectively, $t$ is the downstream travel time (days), $k_d$ is the BOD decay rate (1/d), $k_a$ is the DO reaeration rate (1/d), $o_s$ is the DO saturation concentration (mg/L), and $F_{ox}$ is the BOD/DO inhibition factor (unitless).</p>

  <div class="row row-doc">
    <div class="span3">
      <h3>Initial Conditions</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="span9">
      <p>The equations are solved using the initial concentrations of BOD and DO:</p>
      $$L(t=0) = L_0$$
      $$o(t=0) = o_0$$  
      <p>These initial concentrations are the in-stream concentrations resulting from complete mixing of the discharge with the river. They can be computed as the flow-weighted mean of the discharge concentration and in-stream concentration just upstream of the discharge point, see <a href="#L_0">below</a>.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <hr>
  <div class="row row-doc">
    <div class="span3">
      <h3>Numerical Method</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="span9">
      <p>Given the initial concentrations, the differential equations for BOD and DO as a function of travel time are solved using the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runge%E2%80%93Kutta_methods#Common_fourth-order_Runge.E2.80.93Kutta_method">4th-order Runge-Kutta</a> numerical method.</p> 
      <p>For a generic variable, $y$, with initial condition $y(t=0)=y_0$ and derivative function $f(t, y)=dy/dt$ the solution for $y(t)$ can be computed incrementally. If $h$ is the step size between each solution point, then:</p>
      $$y(t+h) = y(t) + \frac{h}{6}(K_1+K_2+K_3+K_4)$$
      where $K_1$, $K_2$, $K_3$, and $K_4$ are defined as:
      $$
      \begin{eqnarray}
        K_1 & = & f(t, y(t)) \\\
        K_2 & = & f(t + h/2, y(t) + h/2\cdot K_1) \\\
        K_3 & = & f(t + h/2, y(t) + h/2\cdot K_2) \\\
        K_4 & = & f(t + h, y(t) + h\cdot K_3)
      \end{eqnarray}
      $$

    <div class="span3">
      <h3>Travel Time and Distance</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="span9">
      <p>While the equations above describe the concentrations of BOD and DO as functions of travel time, it is often more useful to express the concentrations as functions of distance downstream. Travel time can easily be converted to downstream distance given the velocity of the river flow:</p>
      $$x = 86.4U t$$
      <p>where $x$ is the distance downstream of the discharge point (km), $U$ is the velocity (m/s), $t$ is the travel time (days), and 86.4 is a unit conversion factor (86.4 km/day = 1 m/s).</p>

  <div class="row row-doc">
    <div class="span3">
      <h3>BOD Decay</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="span9">
      <p>The model assumes that BOD decay can be represented as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_decay">first-order decay process</a>. The BOD decay rate depends on two factors:</p>
      <ol>
         <li>Chemical Composition: more complex compounds are more difficult for microbes to decompose, and thus take longer to break down.</li>
         <li>Temperature: microbial processes are often temperature dependent with higher temperatures driving faster rates.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>To account for both these factors, the rate of BOD decay is computed by:</p>
      $$k_d = k_{d,20}\theta_{BOD}^{T-20}$$
      <p>where $k_{d,20}$ is the base decay rate at 20$^\circ$C, $\theta_{BOD}$ is the temperature correction factor, and $T$ is the water temperature (degC). The base decay rate and temperature correction factor are discussed in more detail below.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <hr>
  <div class="row row-doc">
    <div class="span3">
      <h3>DO Inhibition Factor</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="span9">
      <p>The DO inhibition factor is a modification of the original Streeter-Phelps equation that limits the BOD decay rate when DO levels are low. Without this factor, the model can produce negative concentrations of DO, a result that is not physically possible. The inhibition factor is defined using Michaelis-Menton kinetics:</p>
      $$F_{ox} = \frac{o}{k_{so} + o}$$
      <p>where $k_{so}$ is the oxygen inhibition half-saturation constant (mg/L). When the concentration of DO is equal to the half-saturation constant ($o=k_{so}$), then the inhibition factor is $F_{ox}=0.5$ and the rate of BOD decay, $k_d$, is effectively reduced by 50%. As the DO concentration approaches 0 mg/L, the inhibition factor and BOD decay rates also approach 0 preventing further BOD decay when no oxygen is available.</p>
      <p>The following figure shows the relationship between $F_{ox}$ and $o$ for a half-saturation concentration $k_{so} = 1$ mg/L.</p>

  <div class="row row-doc">
    <div class="span3">
      <h3>DO Saturation</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="span9">
      <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygenation_(environmental)">saturation concentration of DO</a> is the concentration at which the water is in equilibrium with the air. When the DO concentration is less than saturation, then the water is said to be under-saturated and oxygen from the air diffuses into the water. Similarly, when the DO level is greater than saturation the water is super-saturated and oxygen is released from the water.</p>
      <p>The DO saturation concentration is automatically computed according to the standard formula (Chapra, 1997):</p>
      $$o_s = -139.34411 + \frac{1.575701\times 10^5}{T_a} - \frac{6.642308\times 10^7}{T_a^2} + \frac{1.243800\times 10^10}{T_a^3} -  \frac{8.621949\times 10^11}{T_a^4}$$
      <p>where $T_a$ is the water temperature in degrees Kelvin ($T_a[K] = T[^\circ C] + 273.15$). Although DO saturation is also affected by salinity and air pressure, we assume the water is freshwater with negligable salinity and located at an air pressure of approximately 1 atm.</p>
      <p>The relationship between DO saturation and water temperature is illustrated in the following figure.</p>

      <h3>DO Reaeration</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="span9">
      <h4>$k_a$: DO reaeration rate (mg/L)</h4>
      <p>The rate of DO reaeration determines the rate at which oxygen is transferred between the water and the air when the DO concentration is above or below the saturation concentration. It is commonly estimated by empirical models.</p>
      <p>The Cover chart is a often used to estimate the reaeration rate based on the depth and velocity of the river (<a href="https://play.google.com/books/reader?id=J0Jpe6q1GlcC&printsec=frontcover&output=reader&authuser=0&hl=en&pg=GBS.PA340">Covar, 1976</a>). The chart combines three empirical studies that were performed on streams of different characteristics. </p>
      <img src="{% static "img/covar.png" %}" alt="" width="483" height="507">
      <p>(extracted from <a href="http://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=9100R3IW.txt">EPA, 1985</a>)</p>
      <p>The equations used in the Cover chart are:</p>
      $$
      k_{a,20} = \left\{ 
        \begin{array}{l l}
          5.32\ U^{0.67} H^{-1.85} & \quad \text{if $H \leq 0.61$ m} & \quad \text{Owens et al. (1964)} \\
          3.93\ U^{0.5} H^{-1.5} & \quad \text{if $H > 0.61$ and $H > 4.15\cdot U^{2.71}$} & \quad \text{O'Connor and Dobbins (1958)} \\
          5.026\ U^{0.969} H^{-1.673} & \quad \text{if $H > 0.61$ and $H <= 4.15\cdot U^{2.71}$} & \quad \text{Churchill et al. (1962)}
        \end{array} \right.
      $$
      <p>where $U$ is the stream velocity (m/s) and H is the mean depth (m). Note that these equations are in the metric form, whereas the chart shows english units.</p>
      <p>Similar to the BOD decay, the reaeration rate is also affected by temperature. The effective reaeration rate, $k_a$, is computed by:</p>
      $$k_a = k_{a,20}\theta_{DO}^{ T-20}$$
      <p>where $k_{a,20}$ is the decay rate at 20$^\circ$C estimated using the Covar chart, $\theta_{DO}$ is the temperature correction factor, and $T$ is the water temperature (degC). The temperature correction factor, $\theta_{DO}$, can be estimated from laboratory experiments, but a typical value of 1.024 is often used (Chapra, 1997).</p>

      <p>The initial concentration of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemical_oxygen_demand">Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD)</a> is in-stream concentration after the discharge has mixed with the river. It can be computed as the flow-weighted mean concentration by:</p>
      $$L_0 = \frac{L_{ps}*Q_{ps} + L_{river}*Q_{river}}{Q_{ps}+Q_{river}}$$
      <p>where $L_{ps}$ and $L_{river}$ are the concentrations of BOD in the discharge and in the river just upstream of the discharge point, and $Q_{ps}$ and $Q_{river}$ are the corresponding flows of the discharge and river.</p>
